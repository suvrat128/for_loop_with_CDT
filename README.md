Looping statements: 

When we have to execute some set of instructions repeatedly then we will use looping statements 

In python we have 2 types of looping statements 

  1. For loop(when u know how many times to iterate) 

  2. While loop (when u r not sure how many times to iterate)

     
For loop: 

For loop will perform below mentioned operations 
  1. initialisation 
  2. traversing 
 
We can use for loop in 3 ways  
  1. With collection data types 
  2. With range function(integers) 
  3. With range function and CDT(index position) 

 
For loop with collection data types: 
Whenever we wants to perform some operations on the elements of collection data type directly with elements then we will use for with a collection . 

Syntax: 

    for variable in CDT: 
        statements of for 
        loop with CDT
